# Instructions
This assignment is focused around working with modules, classes & objects. Look through the models folder in the file directory to see the `child_animal.py` and `parent_animal.py`. The `child_animal` python file shows subclasses of the `parent_animal` file that contains the base class of Animal.

1. There are animal classes needed to be implemented in the `child_animal.py` file.
2. In the `main.py` file, there is a function that needs to be completed for creating objects
3. The classes need to have the **Dunder** method `__repr__` overriden in order to represent the object properly
4. There are no tests for this assignment, instead contact me when you have finished


### Flow of the Program
1. Take user input for choice of animal
2. Take in user input for the fields required for the class
3. Print out the newly created animal object

### Notes

Remember, this application does not need to pass any test. This assignment is focused on your own implementation and it will not necessary follow any easy to handle test. Therefore, when you are complete, save this code to a local environment and contact me.

We will go through this assignment in the lesson and a solution will be provided after the due date not under submission.

## Hints

It is important to be comfortable with working with Classes and Objects in Python. If you have not come across it or you are not comfortable with it, here are some resources:

[Classes & Objects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-classes-and-objects/)

[Constructors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-python/?ref=lbp)

[Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-python/?ref=lbp)

Alongside Classes & Objects, these files are organized in terms of modules. In order to be more organized with your code, and not to have it all in one page, we use modules and import them as needed. If you have not come across this or you are not comfortable with it, here are some resources:

[Python Module 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-modules/)

[Python Module 2](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules)

This is a big part of working with code so make sure you get comfortable with this.
